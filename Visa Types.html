<h3>F1 Visa</h3>
<h5><u>Academic Studies</u></h5>
<p>The <strong>"F" <u>visa</u> is for academic studies.</strong>
  An F1 visa is issued to students who are attending an academic program or English Language Program.
  F1 visas are by far the most common form of international student visa in the U.S.
  F1 students must maintain the minimum course load for full-time student status.
  F1 status allows for part-time, on-campus employment (fewer than 20 hours per week).
  Additionally, students can work on optional practical training (OPT) for up to one year after completion of their academic program.
  Students are expected to complete their studies by the expiration date on the I-20 form (Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status).</P>

<h3>J1 Visa</h3>
<h5><u>Practical Training</u></h5>
<p>A <strong><u>J1 visa</u> is issued to students who need to obtain practical training that is not available in their home country to complete their academic program.</strong>
J-1 student status allows for similar employment as the F1 visa, with similar restrictions, as long as permission is given by the exchange visitor program sponsor.</P>

<br></br>
<h3>M1 Visa</h3>
<h5><u>Non-Academic/Vocational Studies</u></h5>
<p>An M1 visa is issued to a student who is going to attend a non-academic or vocational school.
M-1 visa holders for technical and vocational programs are not permitted to work during the course of their studies.
The M-1 student visa applicants must have evidence that sufficient funds are immediately available to pay all tuition and living costs for the entire period of intended stay.</P>
